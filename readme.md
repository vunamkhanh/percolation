# Percolation

A few methods to generate complex networks for percolation study

The included networks are:

1. Random Networks: generated using the ER method
2. Scale-free Networks: generated using the BA method
3. Small-world Networks: generated using the WS method

Using these three base models, further hybrids and/or combination complex topologies for networks are possible.
